# Programming Club Resources - Davidson Academy 2020-2022

This repository contains presentations, code, and other materials I created when serving as Founder and President of the Davidson Academy's Programming Club from 2020 to 2022. Under my leadership, the club developed skills in the areas of AI/Machine Learning, Robotics, App/GUI Development, and general programming while competing in competitions such as the American Computer Science League and the Kibo Robot Programming Challenge.
